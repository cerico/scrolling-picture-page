Its 6 percent growth rate in 2010 trounced the 2.8 percent expansion in the United States and was stronger than any other developed nation in Europe, until it too hit flat growth in 2012. Since then growth has been more muted, and has followed a similar trajectory to both Portugal and Bulgaria in year on year growth."
